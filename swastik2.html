    <p>When you create a professional profile, blog or website, it's important to help customers or potential employers form a personal connection to you through an "about me" section. This is because personal connections can help individuals learn more about you and potentially increase their interest in your products, services or availability as an employee. Reviewing "about me" examples can help you create your own compelling summary of your values, skills and accomplishments. In this article, we explain what "about me" statements are and share 31 examples to help you create your own effective page.</p>
